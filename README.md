Created a native-app based application to server as a basic weather app.
 
Search Screen 
 
Allow customer to enter a US city
 
Call the openweathermap.org API and display the information you think a user would be interested in seeing. App download and display a weather icon.
 
Auto load the last city searched upon app launch.
 
In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, I'll try to prioritize what we are looking for versus what is less meaningful.
 
Handled:
 
Proper function â€“ requirements met.
 
Well constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code
 
Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
 
Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.

Included: 
 
Automated tests
 
Loosely Coupled Design.
 
Few additional information read from weather forecast server
